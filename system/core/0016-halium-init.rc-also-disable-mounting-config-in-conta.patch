Subject: [PATCH] (halium) init.rc: also disable mounting /config in container

We've decided that we will handle everything USB in the host side.
Leaving this mounted inside the container opens a chance for vendor
HALs to mess with the USB configuration, risking us losing any USB
connection with the device.

A few considerations went into this:
- I've checked that recovery uses a separated copy of this file, and
  will not be affected.
- At least on Volla Phone 22, the only other thing using configfs is
  sdcardfs, which is about the emulated SD card feature on Android and
  is not related to our usecase.
- While this disables the possibility to use vendor HALs to config the
  USB, I think that USB on configfs is a simple enough endeavor that
  can be handled generically given some simple configurations (namely
  desired vendor ID and product IDs). I consider doing it ourselves
  simpler than trying to use the HIDL-ify USB HAL. Besides, any special
  mode available in vendor HALs are likely to be useless without the
  rest of Android stack anyway.
